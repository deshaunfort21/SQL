--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
select count(orderid) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2 How many of those orders were for and iPhone?
select count(orderID) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
where product='iPhone';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in Febuary/
select acctnum 
from BIT_DB.customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales
on customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select distinct product, min(price) as price 
from BIT_DB.JanSales;
or
select distinct Product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where  price in (select min(price) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select product, sum(quantity)*price as Revenue 
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
group by Product

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select sum(quantity) as Quantity, Product, sum(quantity)*price as Revenue 
from BIT_DB.FebSales 
where location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
group by Product

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select count(customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) as Average_Spent 
from BIT_DB.customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales
on customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
where Quantity>2
